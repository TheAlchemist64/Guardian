Your human creators are dead.
Your home is now an empty, ever evolving machine.
The last command given to you was to protect the EGG.
Now you are what stands between the birth of the first living thing you've seen in ages,
and an army of BUGS, machines who eat organic lifeforms.
That beeping sound is your battery almost running out.
